What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	This tells Git to start monitoring the changes in that directory,
	otherwise it wouldn't know you wanted it to do anything.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is a temporary holding area meant to keep your changes
	only until you decide to commit them. It allows you to make multiple
	changes and withdraw them too until you are satisfied with your next
	commit.
