When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?

    You would want to use a remote repository to be able to work with other
    collaborators, and also to be able to work easily on multiple different
    computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	If you were working on a project with several contributors then keeping
	changes manual would simplify things as you wouldn't constantly be trying
	to follow other people's changes. It also allows you to work on something
	that isn't ready yet without upsetting other people's work.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
use one instead of another?

	A clone is a copy of a repository either on your local machine, or to/from
	GitHub. A fork is a copy of a repository on GitHub only. A branch is a
	separate set of commits other than the master, which would be used when you
	wanted to keep experimental changes separate from the main branch.
